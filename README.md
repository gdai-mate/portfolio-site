python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve
```

## Deployment

This site is configured to deploy via GitHub Pages automatically.

## Custom Domain Setup

To use `gdaimate.com.au`:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the repository root with: `gdaimate.com.au`
2. In your domain registrar, add these DNS records:
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `@` (or leave blank for root domain)
   - Value: `gdaimate.github.io`
   - Or use A records pointing to GitHub's IPs if CNAME for root is not supported
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings

GitHub Pages IP addresses (if using A records):
- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153
